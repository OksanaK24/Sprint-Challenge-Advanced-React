- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    1)	You can use state and setState in class component. Otherwise in functional component you have pass all over the props.
    2)	Class component has lifecycle hooks.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    1)	Mounting – componentDidMount; the birth of the component, here it’s created 
    2)	Updating – componentDidUpdate; the growing of the component, here it’s updated
    3)	Unmounting – componentWillUnmount; the death of the component; here it’s removed from the screen

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    You can use custom hook again and again and again. Plus you can customize it when you need. It lets you write your code in “DRY” way. 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    Thanks to the testing we can trust what we wrote; we can find bugs and unpredictable consequences of some actions. If we do some changes and make the mistake by accident (or not) the testing will show us it immediately. Plus it will direct you to that part where you made the mistake.
